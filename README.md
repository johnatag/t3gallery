## Notes

- The extra requirement of using the same deps version as theo in his video presented a significant challenge since:
    - Ever since the publishing of the video, new releases of these deps have been published along with breaking changes
    - My lack of experience using this stack in general made the debugging process a lot lenghtier
    - Google Fonts not loading for some reason...
    - To fix this, I essentially just recreated the same stuff as theo had manually by checking his first initial commit on Github
